-- Q28.3    Recall    the    RobotPart type from the preceding lesson. Make a command-line application that has a database of various RobotParts (at least five), and then lets the user enter in two-part IDs and returns the one with the lowest cost. Handle the case of the user entering an ID thatâ€™s not in the parts database.
import qualified Data.Map as Map -- step 1

data RobotPart = RobotPart
    { name :: String
    , description :: String
    , cost :: Double
    , count :: Int

--2. Create parts. Example robot parts: leftArm, rightArm, and robotHead, robotLeg, robotTail
leftArm :: RobotPart
leftArm  = RobotPart
    { name = "left arm"
    , description = "left arm for face punching!"
    , cost = 1000.00
    , count = 3

rightArm :: RobotPart
rightArm  = RobotPart
    { name = "right arm"
    , description = "right arm for kind hand gestures"
    , cost = 1025.00
    , count = 5
    }
robotHead :: RobotPart
robotHead  = RobotPart
    { name = "robot head"
    , description = "this head looks mad"
    , cost = 5092.25
    , count = 2

robotLeg :: RobotPart
robotLeg  = RobotPart
    { name = "robot leg"
    , description = "this leg looks symmetrical"
    , cost = 7052.25
    , count = 4
    }
robotTail :: RobotPart
robotTail  = RobotPart
    { name = "robot tail"
    , description = "this tail looks hairy"
    , cost = 888.25
    , count = 5
