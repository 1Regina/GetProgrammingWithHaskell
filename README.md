Unit 1
1. Ch02: 3 rules on haskell functions
   1. All functions must take an argument
   2. All functions must return a value
   3. Anytime a function is called with the same argument, it must return the same value. Thus python += cannot exist in Haskell
2. Ch03: lambda is graceful
   1. with `where` at end:
      ```
      sumSquareOrSquareSum :: (Num p, Ord p) => p -> p -> p
                         sumSquareOrSquareSum x y = if sumSquare > squareSum
                                                      then sumSquare
                                                      else squareSum
                                       where sumSquare = x^2 + y^2
                                             squareSum = (x+y)^2
   2. with `let` :
      ```
      sumSquareOrSquareSum5 :: (Ord p, Num p) => p -> p -> p
                      sumSquareOrSquareSum5 x y = let sumSquare = (x^2 + y^2)
                                                      squareSum = ((x+y)^2)
                                                   in
                                                      if sumSquare > squareSum
                                                         then sumSquare
                                                      else squareSum
      ```
   3. lexical scope: nearest is kin:
      1. add3 is always 8 regardless of y:
      ```
      add3 y = (\y ->
                       (\x -> y + x) 1 ) 3
      ```
      2. doubleCube1 is always 64 : `doubleCube1 x = (\cube -> cube ** 3) (4)`
      3. BUT doubleCube will change according to different x: `doubleCube x = (\cube -> cube ** 3) (x * 2)`
3. Ch04: First class functions are functions that can
   1. take functions as input arguments or
   2. return function as its value output.
4. Ch05:
   1. When you capture a value inside a lambda function, this is referred to as a closure.
   2. Anytime you might want to use a closure (which in Haskell is pretty much anytime), you want to order your arguments from most to least general. Closures combine lambda functions and first-class functions to give you amazing power but partial application makes life even easier.
   3. `add4 a b c d = a + b + c + d`;  `addXto3 x = (\b c d ->add4 x b c d)` makes `addXto3` a closure awaiting 3 remaining arguments.
   4. Partial application: When you call any function with fewer than the required number of parameters in Haskell, you get a new function thatâ€™s waiting for the remaining parameters. This language feature is called **partial application**. eg `mystery = add4 3` so 3 becomes the standard staple that will always be included such that `mystery 2 3 4 = 12`
   5. In case where most to least general arguments order was not followed and need correction, instead of rewriting, try a way to **flip** them round. Given previously which shd have location first then name:
      ```
      addressLetter name location = locationFunction name
            where locationFunction = getLocationFunction location
      ```
      > Rectify by
      ```
      addressLetterV2 location name = addressLetter name location
      ```
      > To avoid repeating for each function, further rectify easily using lambda function, first-class functions, and a closure by
      ```
      flipBinaryArgs binaryFunction = (\x y -> binaryFunction y x)
      ```
      > This results in
      ```
      addressLetterV2 = flipBinaryArgs addressLetter
      addressLetterNY = addressLetterV2 "ny"
      ```
      > Proxy for partial application: function binaryPartialApplication that takes a binary function and one argument and returns a new function waiting for the missing argument. Binary function is one that needs 2 argument e.g (+, /, -, *)

      ```
      binaryPartialApplication binaryFunction arg = (\y -> binaryFunction arg y)
      ```
    6. Infix operators such as (+, /, -, *) can be used as a prefix function by putting parentheses around it:
      ```
      GHCi> 10 / 2
      5.0
      GHCi> (/) 10 2
      5.0
      ```
