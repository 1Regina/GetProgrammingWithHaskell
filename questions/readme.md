1. <solve> can compile but cannot run the program 'main' in ghci to input numbers to sum.
   1.  ghc --make sum
   2.  ./sum

2. <solve> unit4/lesson22/l22_1exercises.hs cant compile
   1. getContents is for everything into 1 string regardless of how many time u hit enter
   2. better to use getLine if there are several IO steps

3. unit6/lesson34/l34_exercises/glitchArt can compile with `ghc Main.hs` but when `./Main  ` i get error `Main: Prelude.head: empty list`...previously taken from unit4/lesson25

4. question: I would stack new to start a project, adjust package.yaml then stack run to make sure the dependencies go into the .cabal file. But stack run always take a long time with a message of xxMB

5. <solved> [https://github.com/shinharad/get-programming-with-haskell/blob/master/unit7/lesson40/app/Main.hs] I could power up unit7/lesson40/json-lesson but when keep getting error "error loading data" when i run stack ghci main

6. <solved> `cd unit7/lesson41/db-lesson` then `stack exec db-lesson-exe` but error in IO program **error** checkin command collapse after I enter the id of the tool. https://github.com/Rhywun/get-programming-with-haskell/blob/master/Unit07/Lesson41/db-lesson/app/Main.hs has this dontBuffer function

7. `cd unit7/lesson41/db-lesson` then `stack exec db-lesson-exe` all functions ok except chapt exercise q1.
