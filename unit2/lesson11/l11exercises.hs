-- Q11.1
-- filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
-- >>> filter even [2,4,5,6,7]
-- [2,4,6]
--
-- filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
-- If you look at map, you can see there are two differences:
-- map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
-- First is that the function passed into filter must return a Bool.Second is that map can transform the type of the list, whereas filter canâ€™t

-- Filter apply a function that generate a bool when applied to a list and output only those elements in the list that meets (ie True) the bool function.

-- Map apply any function (^2 or +1 ) to a list and output the transformed values of every element of the list.
